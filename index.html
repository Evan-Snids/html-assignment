            <h2>This website is all about <strong>ME!</strong></h2>
            <p>One thing that is very notable about me is that I am a lot like my dad. I like to think that my dad planned for me to be like this because he wanted a little him and I mean if thats what he wanted, I guess it worked. I am big into video games and probably play too much, like <strong>TOO MUCH</strong>. I also just <em>love</em> all superhero things and scifi/fantasy things. Right now my <strong>favourite</strong> game right now has to be Elden Ring so if you know anything about it you can tell its a big nerd game.</p>

            <p>Another thing about me is that my family owns a <abbr title="JiuJitsu">JJ</abbr> company named <mark>Outlaw Martial Arts</mark> and both my mom and step dad are <strong>BLACK BELTS</strong>. Not only does my step dad have a black belt in japanese jiu jitsu but also in brazilian. Its cool too because he is a 3<sup>rd</sup> degree black in traditional which takes a long long time to get. Its really crazy to me because I never saw my mom being a black belt in any <em>martial art</em> but now that she is its so fitting in my mind.</p>
